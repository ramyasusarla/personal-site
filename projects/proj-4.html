<p><a href = "https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-use-software-bots-to-process-surge-of-pandemic-related-loans-11591735728"><strong>Bots & Bank Loans: </strong></a> The Paycheck Protection Program, launched in April, offers low-cost loans to small businesses amid the Coronavirus pandemic. As a result, the US Small Business Administration has been left with the daunting task of processing thousands of loans (keep in mind: the bank usually only processes 1,000 loans per year!). To accomodate to the high volume of loans, the administration has relied on robots developed by Blue Prism Group PLC to extract data from loan applications, create databases with preloaded file information, calculate loan amounts, and prepare documents for clients. The vice-president of Blue Prism said the bots process loans 30 times faster than a person, a metric that is essential considering the number of small business relying on the timely issuance of these loans. Currently, Blue Prism is looking to extend the capabilities of these bots to include loan forgiveness, void checks for fraud, and mortgage forbearance. The success of such bots raises questions about the role automation will play after the pandemic ends. </p>

If a user is diagnosed with COVID-19, doctors will share a QR code with them that can then be used to notify users they've interacted with in the last 2 weeks. The server, also, has an associated risk score with each user. Once a user's risk score goes above a certain threshold they will be notified and recommended to get tested. France's app is unique because it does not use Apple and Google's contact-tracting API. The centralized design of the app, a contrast to Italy and Switzerland's decentralized technology, have raised concerns regarding user privacy. However, proponents of the centralized technology argue that the extra data only aids epidemiologists and poses no privacy concerns. It will be interesting to see the results of the newly released app and if similar measures will be employed in the US.</p>
