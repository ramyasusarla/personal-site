<p><a href = "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52905448"><strong>June 3, 2020: </strong></a>StopCovid France is France's contact tracing app that utilizes anonymous IDs and bluetooth to record the IDs of app users around you. If a user is diagnosed with COVID-19, doctors will share a QR code with them that can then be used to notify users they've interacted with in the last 2 weeks. The server, also, has an associated risk score with each user. Once a user's risk score goes above a certain threshold they will be notified and recommended to get tested. France's app is unique because it does not use Apple and Google's contact-tracting API. The centralized design of the app, a contrast to Italy and Switzerland's decentralized technology, have raised concerns regarding user privacy. However, proponents of the centralized technology argue that the extra data only aids epidemiologists and poses no privacy concerns. It will be interesting to see the results of the newly released app and if similar measures will be employed in the US.</p>
