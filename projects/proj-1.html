<p><strong> Robotic head that helps children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) better understand emotions.</strong></p>
<p>Currently, the average diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) occurs after the age 5. This late diagnosis prevents children with ASD from seeking out resources and services that can aid normal development. As a result, children with ASD are disadvantaged in the classroom, because they're unable to properly interact and communicate with peers and teachers. For my capstone project, I set out to combat this prevalent issue by constructing a robot that helps children with ASD improve their emotion recognition. My goal was to build a robot that could display the 6 basic emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust as outlined by the psychologist Paul Eckman. Those  with ASD could then interact with the robot's various emotions and identify them.
</p>
<p>For the construction of the robotic head I used the Fritz Animotronic Robotic Head tutorial as guidance. I first began by manipulating the CAD structuresto better the wire, screw, and servo dimensions, and then laser cut the necessary parts onto ¼” wood. The next step was 3D printing the eyebox structure for the robot using the MakerBot printer. This took multiple attempts as the eyelid portions required 3D supports and many of the parts weren’t printed with enough accuracy.

<p>I started by putting together the various parts of the project separately. These sections were the eyebox, front / mouth region, neck, and then the back cover. The construction of the eyebox was incredibly complicated, and I ran into a lot of issues finding wire controls that were the correct dimensions for the 3D printed parts. After much deliberation, I chose to omit the blinking feature as I didn’t believe that it would greatly aid in the display of emotion. I then moved on to the front / mouth region which mainly required the placement of the mini servos. The neck feature also required the addition of a servos.

<p>I used the Arduino Leonardo microcontroller fitted with a Vexmas shield for the wiring of the 6 servos. I powered the board with a 12V rechargeable battery. Wiring the robotic head in an organized and aesthetically pleasing manner proved a little challenging, because the Leonardo had to be mounted on the back portion of the robot to be properly concealed. After a bit of maneuvering, I finally figured it out! I assembled the different sections together and was ready to begin coding.

<p>Coding the six emotions entailed coordinating the 6 servos that controlled the 2 brow bones, 2 mouth pieces, jaw, and neck. I used the arduino platform and C++ language to correctly set the values by testing different positions and isolating the movements of the servos. </p>
<p>In the end, the robot had successful motion of six components - 2 brow bones, 2 mouth pieces, jaw, and neck. The coordinated movement of these six parts allowed for the successful display of four out of the six emotions identified at the beginning of the project. The emotions of fear and disgust were unable to be displayed because they looked too similar to those of sadness and anger, respectively. </p>

<p>The project outlined in this site is evidence of the existence of a simple, affordable technological solution that can help children with Autism Spectrum Disorder better recognize emotions. Short term goals and additions to this project include:
<p>
1. Additions of a wider range of emotions, specifically the emotions of fear and disgust that were not successfully displayed during this construction of the robot</p>
<p>2. Develop an attachable body portion to the robotic head to create a full-body humanoid robot. The use of a full-body humanoid robot will allow for the display of emotions to also include body language, a complex yet essential component of emotional communication.</p>
<p>3. Investigate the applications of implementing a conversational factor to the robot that can converse with the children based on presets. The responses of the robot would be controlled by an individual such as a parent or teacher, and the goal would be to have a conversation where the child would be forced to respond to the emotional responses of the robot. For example, if the robot displayed sadness the child’s reaction should be to comfort them. </p>
